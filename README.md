# Crime Map 

This is the second example project from my book Flask By Example (https://flaskbyexample.com)

This project focuses on:
* Adding a database (MySQL) to a Flask application
* Using the Google Maps widget
* Some basic JavaScript
* Mitigation against SQL injection and XSS

Note that, as with the previous project, the focus is on education and building things from scratch instead of using blindly using pre-existing frameworks. This code should not be taken as an example of production-ready code.
